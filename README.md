Script converts a Dual Fisheye image from a Canon R7 camera into two thing:

1. A Spatial photo for display on an Apple Vision Pro
   - Uses the spatial command
   - Uses ffmpeg
   - Uses Topaz Photo in command line mode (you can edit around this)
  
2. Creates an anaglyph jpg image that can be viewed with red/green 3d glasses and you can print this image to be viewed with 3d glasses.
